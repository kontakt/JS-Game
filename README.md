JS-Game
=======

This is an idea I've been wanting to implement for a while.

I decided to work with JavaScript via Three.js because I want to become more experienced in JavaScript.

All my code is cobbled together with duct-tape and toothpicks, so don't expect massive performance.

Updates will be made in my spare time, whenever I get the enthusiasm to code more.
